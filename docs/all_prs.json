But I'd like to understand the problem... IIUC it was a [change on runtime-rs\/Makefile](https:\/\/github.com\/kata-containers\/kata-containers\/pull\/8070\/commits\/2d19f3fbd7bf41433c5d98d3bf43be660b5320c5#diff-21ae7c3a772119d42eee8b5e9037558e76af7b5e792398161985ae884ac1c461) that broke qemu-runtime-rs, but looking at your commit here I couldn't identify exactly what config value that changed. Mind to explain?","https:\/\/github.com\/kata-containers\/kata-containers\/pull\/10052\/files#diff-21ae7c3a772119d42eee8b5e9037558e76af7b5e792398161985ae884ac1c461L317 this is the part where it failed for qemu. That's the reason we moved every variable to have a custom, per-hypervisor instance, so that each one hypervisor gets its pre-defined one.","Thanks @ananos , this fix is great news!  However, after spending (too much) time trying to figure out what this change actually does I'm noticing it contains a lot of what looks like spurious change (mostly lines just moved around).  I suggest that you either revert those parts of the change if they are in fact spurious, or separate them into a standalone clean-up commit so as they don't obfuscate the actual functional core of this change.\r\n\r\nAlso, I'm under the impression that the idea of this change is to walk away from general settings valid across hypervisors (e.g. `DEFSTATICRESOURCEMGMT`), potentially customised by hypervisor-specific variants (e.g. `DEFSTATICRESOURCEMGMT_CLH`), and to fully rely on hypervisor-specific settings instead.  If that's the case this should be explicitly stated in the message of a commit that implements this transition (and this transition only).\r\n\r\nThis change fixes breakage caused by PR #8070 after a week's struggle due to the sheer size and impenetrability of #8070.  It would be a shame if the fix was another commit of that same kind. :-)","agree 100%. The sheer fact that the Makefile logic assumes that if more hypervisors are available then the last one would override vars set by the previous ones seems misleading. I will update the commit message to reflect that.\r\n\r\nThe rationale was that this one commit adds per-hypervisor options, trying to address the above issue. But I agree we need to clarify it even more, so I'll split the commit into two: \r\n- first one will add the KERNELPARAMS_FC, decoupling the KERNELPARAMS var for FC\r\n- second one will add the per-hypervisor vars for the resource mgt\/cgroups etc.\r\n\r\nwill update later today and see how that plays out with the tests. I see a couple of required tests failing, not sure why."],"user_login":"ananos","user_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/ananos"},{"url":"https:\/\/github.com\/kata-containers\/kata-containers\/pull\/9964","title":"ci: Cleanup working dir when using self-hosted runners","created_at":"2024-07-04T13:47:02Z","state":"closed","merged_at":null,"approved":true,"comments":["@ananos, I'd prefer having that as part of the node configuration, like: https:\/\/docs.github.com\/en\/actions\/hosting-your-own-runners\/managing-self-hosted-runners\/running-scripts-before-or-after-a-job\r\n\r\nAnd I'd like to have those scripts as part of the repo, so anyone setting up a new runner could just copy and paste then to the correct location.","@fidencio This is in the works by https:\/\/github.com\/kata-containers\/kata-containers\/issues\/9934  this is to unblock the CI and once @BbolroC is done with the POC we will create something as you already said for \"ALL\" selfhosted-runners","Please have a look at https:\/\/github.com\/kata-containers\/kata-containers\/issues\/9934#issuecomment-2258094441 if you follow Fabi's suggestion.

We need to do some refactoring at some point, but for now, we can explicitly call `ticker.Stop()` before calling `log.Fatal`, or try to do some refactoring.","Do you have any suggestions for refactoring? My initial thoughts would be to encapsulate a part of the main function within a separate function. This wrapper function should return an error containing the precise message that would be printed by log.Fatalf(). That way, the `defer ticker.Stop()` statement will run, while still allowing the use of log.Fatalf() in the main function to keep the user-facing messages unchanged.","That sounds great. Over time, I'd like to split up the main loop into smaller functions, but for now, wrapping it would be good.","I wrapped the loop in a separate function and modified the ticker loop to get an immediate fisrt tick.
